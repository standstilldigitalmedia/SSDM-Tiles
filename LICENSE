SSDM-Tiles belongs to everyone.

This addon is for dreamers - the solo developers and tiny teams who are
building something amazing on a shoestring budget. You don't need permission.
You don't need to give credit. You don't need a lawyer.

Use it, modify it, sell it, break it, fix it, ship it in your game, or tear
it apart to learn from it. Do whatever you want with it.

Want to fork it and rename it? Go ahead. Want to use the name "SSDM-Tiles"
for your modified version? That's fine too - I'm not trademarking it. Want to
use the logo? It's yours. Make a better one and I might even use it.

No fees. No credit required. No worries.

Here's what I (Standstill Digital Media) am NOT responsible for:

If this breaks your project, crashes your game, or makes your computer catch
fire - that's on you, not me. I have zero legal obligation to fix bugs,
answer questions, or support this project. The warranty disclaimer below makes
this official.

That said, I actually care about this community. If you run into issues, I'll
probably try to help because I want to see you succeed. But that's my choice,
not my obligation. Your deadlines are your problem, not mine.

Now go make something awesome.
